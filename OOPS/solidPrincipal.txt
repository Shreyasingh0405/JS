The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help in creating more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software. They are:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This principle helps in keeping classes focused and easier to manage.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities (such as classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to extend the behavior of a class without altering its existing code, which can be achieved using interfaces or abstract classes.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Essentially, subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes, meaning they should adhere to the expectations set by the base class.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle encourages the creation of smaller, more specific interfaces rather than a large, general-purpose interface.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle aims to decouple code and reduce the dependency on concrete implementations.

Applying these principles can lead to code that is more modular, easier to test, and adaptable to change.
